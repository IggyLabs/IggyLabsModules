## Table

### Intro
Table is a wavetable oscillator for user-provided wavetables, like those you might import into a VST wavetable synthesizer. 

I recommend trying out [WaveEdit](https://synthtech.com/waveedit) by Synthesis Technology; it is a free, open-source wavetable editor for PC/Mac/Linux. If you are an Xfer Serum user, you are also already probably aware of the powerful wavetable editor available. If you're not interested in making your own wavetables, you can also find countless wavetables online. 

Wherever you get your wavetables, be sure to note the length of a frame or cycle. This is necessary information for correctly importing into Table.

### Use
To import a wavetable, right click on the module, and select "Load wavetable." Load in your .wav file, and you're good to go!

### Parameters
Table has three parameters:

1. pos: The position in the wavetable
2. fine: Fine frequency tuning
3. V/oct: Coarse, semitone frequency tuning
